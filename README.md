This is Hana Kim's submission for the assignment (Tumblr prototype) for Week 5 in the Codepath, September 2014 iOS for Designers class.


**Time Spent:** 8 Hours


#### Completed User Stories

* Tapping on Home, Search, Account, or Trending should show the respective screen and highlight the tab bar button.
* Compose button should modally present the compose screen.
* **Optional**: Compose screen is faded in while the buttons animate in.
* **Optional**: Login button should show animate the login form over the view controller.
* **Optional**: Discover bubble should bob up and down unless the SearchViewController is tapped.


#### Completed User Stories
* I added an image that looked more like the example GIF for the trending screen, rather than the one presented.
